Made by Michael Kovalsky for Manheim part 1

Run it as you normally would, the months have to be double clicked to work, strange behavior, unsure why. 

Man change from original website is that the months do not load a whole new page, instead, it loads the
html files into their own div. In other words, ajax. I went with this solution as I recalled that during
my web programming class our professor mentioned that we should only reload a page when it makes sense. 
Also, it seemed better to do so than retyping the same nav bar design for each month html file
